# Get SSL Certificate for you FROST-Server and Grafana Server

## Generate CSR key
This is based on instructions from [here](https://dzone.com/articles/keytool-commandutility-to-generate-a-keystorecerti)
1. Interactive bash into the container running the FROST-Server with the following command
    ```
    sudo docker exec -it -u root ContainerName bash
    ```
2. You will be logged into the container as root with the -u 0 option. Generate a keystore with the following command.
    ```
    keytool -genkey -alias $domain_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore $file_name.jks

    substitute $domain_name and $file_name with your real domain name. For example, if your URL is chaosbox.princeton.com, your $domain_name = chaosbox

    for self-signed cert you can add in the validity option

    keytool -genkey -alias $domain_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore $file_name.jks -validity 365
    ```

    a. You will be prompted to fill in the following parameters. Remember your keystore password.
    ```
    Enter keystore password:
    Re-enter new password:
    What is your first and last name?
      [Unknown]:  andlchaos300l.xyz.com
    What is the name of your organizational unit?
      [Unknown]:  your_unit
    What is the name of your organization?
      [Unknown]:  your organization
    What is the name of your City or Locality?
      [Unknown]:  City
    What is the name of your State or Province?
      [Unknown]:  State
    What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
      [Unknown]:  Country
    Is CN=andlchaos300l.xyz.com, OU=your_unit, O=your organization, L=Princeton, ST=New Jersey, C=US correct?
      [no]:  yes
    ```

    b. The .jks file will be generated in the directory.

3. Generate the CSR file to be signed.
    ```
    $ keytool -certreq -alias $domain_name -keystore $domain_name.jks -file $csr_key.csr
    ```
## Install the Signed Certificate for FROST-Server
1. Import the signed certificate into the keystore with this command. First import the root certificate. These instructions are based on this [post](https://www.ssls.com/knowledgebase/how-to-install-an-ssl-certificate-on-a-tomcat-server/#PKCS12).
    ```
    $ keytool -import -alias root -keystore $domain_name.jks -file root.crt
    ```
    a. Then import the intermediate certificate.
    ```
    $ keytool -import -alias intermediate -keystore $domain_name.jks -file intermediate.crt
    ```
    b. Then import the domain certificate.
    ```
    $ keytool -import -alias $domain_name -keystore $domain_name.jks -file domain.crt

    You will get the message 'Certificate reply was installed in keystore'.

    The alias name have to correspond to the domain name of your webpage
    ```
    c. You can check the installed certificates with this command.
    ```
    $ keytool -list -v -keystore $domain_name.jks -storepass $password
    ```
    b. If you want to delete certificate you can do it with this command.
    ```
    $ keytool -delete -alias $aliasname -keystore $domain_name.jks -storepass $password
    ```

2. Next, in the container you will have to edit the setting in Tomcat, update the apt-get software and install vim for editing text file. If you did not sign the CSR you can still do this to create a self-signed URL.
    ```
    $ apt-get update

    $ apt-get install vim
    ```

3. Once installed, open the server.xml file at the conf directory.
    ```
    $ vi conf/server.xml
    ```

    a. Go to the connector segment shown below.
    ```
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
                connectionTimeout="20000"
                redirectPort="8443" />
    ```

    b. Add these extra settings to enable https encryption.
    ```
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
                connectionTimeout="20000"
                redirectPort="8443"
                SSLEnabled="true"
                scheme="https"
                keystoreFile="keystorefile.jks"
                keystorePass="keystore_password"
                clientAuth="false"
                sslProtocol="TLS"/>
    ```

4. Restart your container. The URL will start with https now.
    ```
    $ sudo docker restart $container_name
    ```
## Install the Signed Certificate for Grafana
The instruction here is based on this [post](https://community.grafana.com/t/grafana-https-configuration/524)

1. Export the certificate and private key from the keytool (I have assumed you are using keytool from the frost server container). I assumed you have imported all the signed certificates into the keystore. You can then run this command to export the cert.pem (signed certificate) and key.pem (private key) for use in the granfana server. Instructions here are based on this [post](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3779/how-can-i-export-my-private-key-from-a-java-keytool-keystore)
    ```
    $ keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore $domain_name.jks -destkeystore $keystore.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12 -srcalias $domain_name -deststorepass $your_password -destkeypass $your_password
    ```

2. Once you $keystore.p12 is created. Use openssl to export the certificate with this command.
    ```
    $ openssl pkcs12 -in $keystore.p12 -nokeys -out $cert.pem
    ```

3. Generate the private key with this command.
    ```
    $ openssl pkcs12 -in $keystore.p12 -nodes -nocerts -out $key.pem
    ```

4. Once you have both the key.pem and cert.pem. Copy the two pem files into the Grafana container.
    ```
    $ sudo docker cp path/to/cert.pem $grafana_container_name:/etc/grafana

    $ sudo docker cp path/to/key.pem $grafana_container_name:/etc/grafana
    ```

5. Go into the Grafana container go to the directory /etc/grafana. These instructions are based on this [post](https://medium.com/grafana-tutorials/adding-ssl-to-grafana-eb4ab634e43f)
    ```
    $ sudo docker exec -it -u root $grafana_container_name bash
    ```

    a. Change the permission of the files to allow Grafana to read them.
    ```
    $ chmod 640 /etc/grafana/cert.pem
    $ chmod 640 /etc/grafana/key.pem
    ```

    b. using Vim, open the file 'grafana.ini'
    ```
    $ vi grafana.ini
    ```
    
    c. Uncomment (remove the ; infront of the line) and make the following changes to the grafana.ini file.
    ```
    [server]
    protocol = https
    cert_file = /etc/grafana/cert.pem
    cert_key = /etc/grafana/key.pem
    ```
6. Once all this is done. Restart the Grafana container.
    ```
    $ sudo docker restart $grafana_container_name
    ```
