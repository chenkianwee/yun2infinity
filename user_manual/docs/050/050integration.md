# Integration
I have made some customisation for each software for Masa3DB. This section documents the inner tweaks that I have done for the integration. In this section I have included both working and failed integration. As this is still a work-in-progress, I am documenting the failed attempt, so that I can remember what have been attempted and failed. This is beneficial 1) I won't repeat the same mistakes and 2) if I decided to try again I can pick up from the failed attempts.
