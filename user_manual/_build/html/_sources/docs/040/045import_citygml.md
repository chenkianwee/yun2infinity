# Import CityGML
## Official Method (Not Working)
1. Download the [3D City Database Importer/Exporter](https://www.3dcitydb.org/3dcitydb/d3dimpexp/)

    a. You will need to install Java for the installer to work. Install Java [here](https://java.com/en/download/)

2. Once installed you will need to connect to the database. (However it cannot connect to a PostgreSQL database through a SSL connection.) This method is currently not working.

    ```{figure} /_static/045import_citygml/3dcitydb_connect.png
    :scale: 60%
    :name: 3dcitydb_connect

    There are no SSL connection settings.
    ```
3. You can still use the software to validate your CityGML file.

    :name: 3dcitydb_import
