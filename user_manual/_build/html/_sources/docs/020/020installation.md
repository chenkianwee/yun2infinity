# Installation
I am using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for running the database. So you will have to install Docker on your machine. Refer to the next section to install Docker. Once Docker is installed, I have written a shellscript to automatically fetch all the necessary Docker containers to get the database up and running. Currently, the shellscript has only been tested with an Ubuntu machine. In summary:
1. Install Docker
2. Install Masa3DB

## Docker
